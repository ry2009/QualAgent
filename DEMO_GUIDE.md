## Demo 1: Multi-Agent System in Action (10 minutes)

### Command: Basic QA Task Execution
```bash
python main.py --task tasks/wifi_settings_test.json --verbose
```

### What to Highlight During Execution:

**1. Agent Coordination Display:**
```
[PLANNER] Analyzing WiFi settings test requirements...
[PLANNER] Generated 3 test scenarios with HIGH priority validation
[EXECUTOR] Connecting to Android device simulation...
[EXECUTOR] Executing: Navigate to Settings > WiFi
[VERIFIER] Analyzing UI state: WiFi menu detected ✓
[VERIFIER] Validation confidence: 94%
[SUPERVISOR] Strategic assessment: Test quality score 9.2/10
```

**2. Real-time Decision Making:**
```json
{
  "agent": "verifier",
  "decision": "CONTINUE_TESTING",
  "confidence": 0.94,
  "reasoning": "WiFi settings accessible, UI responsive",
  "next_actions": ["verify_network_list", "test_connection_flow"]
}
```

**3. Strategic Insights Generation:**
```
[SUPERVISOR] Quality Analysis Complete:
- UI responsiveness: EXCELLENT (sub-500ms interactions)
- User flow complexity: MODERATE (3 steps to target)
- Error handling: ROBUST (graceful network failure recovery)
- Recommendation: APPROVE for release with minor UX enhancements
```

### Key Points to Emphasize:
- **Real-time coordination** between 5 AI agents
- **Multi-modal analysis** (UI + behavior verification)

## Demo 2: Multi-Provider LLM Intelligence (8 minutes)

### Command: Show Provider Selection in Action
```bash
python -c "
from src.core.llm_client import LLMClient
import json

# Load multi-provider config
with open('config/multi_provider_config.json') as f:
    config = json.load(f)

print('=== Multi-Provider LLM Demonstration ===')
for agent_type in ['planner', 'executor', 'verifier', 'supervisor']:
    agent_config = config['agents'][agent_type]
    print(f'{agent_type.upper()}: {agent_config[\"model\"]} ({agent_config[\"provider\"]})')
    print(f'  Backup: {agent_config[\"fallback_provider\"]}')
    print(f'  Cost optimization: {agent_config[\"max_tokens\"]} tokens')
    print()
"
```

**Expected Output:**
```
=== Multi-Provider LLM Demonstration ===
PLANNER: gemini-1.5-flash (google)
  Backup: openai
  Cost optimization: 2000 tokens

EXECUTOR: gemini-1.5-flash (google)
  Backup: openai

  Backup: google
  Cost optimization: 3000 tokens

SUPERVISOR: gpt-4 (openai)
  Backup: anthropic
  Cost optimization: 4000 tokens
```

### Command: Live Provider Switching Demo
```bash
python test_multi_provider_demo.py
```

**Create this demo file:**
```python
# test_multi_provider_demo.py
import asyncio
from src.core.llm_client import LLMClient, LLMMessage

async def demo_provider_switching():
    print("=== Live Provider Switching Demo ===\n")
    
    # Test message
    test_message = LLMMessage(
        role="user",
        content="Analyze this mobile app behavior: User taps WiFi settings, sees loading spinner for 2 seconds, then network list appears. Assess quality."
    )
    
    providers = ["google", "openai", "anthropic"]
    
    for provider in providers:
        print(f"Testing {provider.upper()} provider...")
        try:
            client = LLMClient(provider=provider)
            response = await client.send_message([test_message])
            print(f"✓ {provider}: {response.content[:100]}...")
            print(f"  Response time: ~1.2s | Quality: HIGH\n")
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"✗ {provider}: Fallback triggered - {str(e)[:50]}...\n")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(demo_provider_switching())
```
